# Intro

QGraphTad is the first model to incorporate core principles of quantum cognition into B-cell epitope prediction tasks, utilizing richer high-dimensional quantum state-encoded features and undergoing simulated quantum operations, including rotation, entanglement, and measurement projection, to simulate the structural polymorphism and global interactions of proteins, thereby enhancing feature expression and attention modeling capabilities. A quantum-enhanced network employing a multi-head attention mechanism based on quantum entanglement and dense graphs, integrated with modules similar to visual transformers to capture complex structural dependencies. Conformation-based B-cell epitope prediction is achieved through a quantum multi-layer perceptron.
