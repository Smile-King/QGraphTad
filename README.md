# Intro
 a novel quantum-inspired model for predicting conformational B-cell epitopes, named QGraphTad, is proposed. The protein sequence is characterized by sequence embeddings and predcited structure, which are generated by pre-trained protein language model ESM-2 and AlphaFold2 respectively. These features are subsequently encoded into high-dimensional quantum states and undergo simulated quantum feature encoding (QFE) operations, including rotation, entanglement, and measurement projection, to simulate the structural polymorphism and global interactions of proteins. Then a quantum-enhanced network (QEN) consisting mainly of projection layer, Quantum graph attention (GAT) layer and position-encoded transformer encoders (PTE) is designed to capture complex structure-dependent relationships. Simultaneously, the output from the QFE module is also fed into three-layer transformer encoder network (TEN) to model global contextual relationships within antigen sequences. After fusing the representations derived from QEN and TEN, the combined features are processed by quantum-enhanced multilayer perceptrons (QMLP) to predict conformational B-cell epitopes (BCEs).

# System requirement
QGraphTad is developed under Linux environment with:
- 1 python 3.9.12
- 2 numpy 1.24.3
- 3 pandas 2.1.4
- 4 fair-esm 2.0.1
- 5 torch 1.12.1
- 6 pytorch-lightning 1.6.4
- 7 (optional) esmfold

# Software requirement
To run the full & accurate version of GraphBepi, you need to make sure the following software is in the [mkdssp](./mkdssp) directory:  
[DSSP](https://github.com/cmbi/dssp) (*dssp ver 2.0.4* is Already in this repository) 
# Build dataset
1. `git clone https://github.com/Smile-King/QGraphTad.git && cd QGraphTad`
2. `python dataset.py --gpu 0`

It will take about 20 minutes to download the pretrained ESM-2 model and an hour to build our dataset with CUDA.

# Run QGraphTad for training
After building our dataset ***BCE_633***, train the model with default hyper params:
```
python train.py --dataset BCE_633
```
# Run QGraphTad for prediction
1) If you want to skip the training steps, you can go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qDq-3L1CfKLnBFCD5_d05HYcpW6c-CzW?usp=sharing)download our pre-trained model files and replace the model folder in the current folder to proceed directly to the testing steps.
2) Please execute the following command directly if you can provide the PDB file.
3) If you do not have a PDB file, you can use [AlphaFold2](http://bio-web1.nscc-gz.cn/app/alphaFold2_bio) to predict the protein structure. 

```
python test.py -i pdb_file -p --gpu 0 -o ./output
```

or

use a faster structural prediction model [ESMFold](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm) in our project, so you can process the sequences directly by following the commands below.

```
python test.py -i fasta_file -f --gpu 0 -o ./output
```
